## 1st December

Today was quite productive as I explored several new concepts and solved some challenging problems.

### Three.js Learning
I focused on several core topics in Three.js today, including:
- **Scene**
- **Camera**
- **Object**
- **Light**
- **Renderer**
- **Orbital Control**
- **Animation**

These components are crucial for creating engaging 3D visualizations on the web, and I'm feeling more confident in using them effectively.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
After that, I switched gears to work on string and stack topics. Here are the problems I solved:

1. **Valid Palindrome**  
   - Solution: Used two pointers, traversing from both ends and comparing the characters.
2. **Valid Anagram**  
   - Solution: Utilized two HashMaps and compared them using the `.equals` function.
3. **Valid Parentheses**  
   - Solution: Implemented a stack to push open brackets and validated them against the closing ones.
4. **Remove Consecutive Characters**  
   - Solution: Used `StringBuilder` to append characters by cross-checking consecutive duplicates.

It was great to refresh my understanding of String, `StringBuilder`, and Stack while also solving practical problems.

That's all for today! I'll be back tomorrow with more updates.

## 2nd December

Today was quite a productive day as I made significant progress on a couple of different fronts.

### Portfolio Website Development

I started building my portfolio website using **React Three Fiber** and **globe.gl** to add a 3D globe to the site. The integration of the 3D globe will create a more interactive and engaging experience for visitors. React Three Fiber has been quite interesting to work with so far, especially in making a 3D visualization functional within a React environment.

### Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

In addition to my work on the portfolio, I also focused on solving a few algorithmic problems related to strings. Here are the questions I solved today:

1. **Longest Common Prefix**  
   - Solution: Implemented a loop to compare the characters of each string in the array, stopping when mismatches were found.

2. **Convert a Sentence into its Equivalent Mobile Numeric Keypad Sequence**  
   - Solution: Used a `HashMap` to map each character to its corresponding numeric value, then used a `StringBuilder` to build the sequence.

3. **Print all the Duplicates in the Input String**  
   - Solution: Created a `HashMap` to map characters and their frequencies, then printed those with a frequency greater than 1.

4. **Longest Substring without Repeating Characters**  
   - Solution: Utilized a sliding window approach with two pointers, combined with a `boolean` array to track visited characters.

5. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**  
   - Solution: Used a two-pointer sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring with repeating characters after a given number of replacements.

### Keynotes
- Using the `substring()` and `indexOf()` methods to generate substrings effectively.
- Leveraging `HashMap` to manage character-to-frequency relationships and streamline tasks like finding duplicates or converting characters.
- Practicing double pointers and sliding window techniques, which are particularly useful for efficiently solving problems involving substrings.

Overall, I had a good mix of both creative and analytical tasks today, which kept me engaged and motivated. Looking forward to more coding adventures tomorrow!

## 3rd December

Today was a mixed bag of productivity and missed opportunities. While I couldn't dedicate time to my Java coding, I made significant progress on my website development, which feels rewarding yet bittersweet.

### Website Development
I spent most of the day focusing on completing my website. One of the highlights was learning about **Email.js**, an amazing tool for implementing an automated mailing system. This feature is perfect for anyone who wants to get in touch with me directly through my site, and I’m excited to integrate it into my project.

#### Key Takeaways About Email.js:
- Easy integration with JavaScript.
- Supports personalized email templates.
- Simplifies automated email workflows without requiring a backend.

It’s a small but impactful addition to my website, and I’m genuinely happy with how it turned out.

### Missed Opportunity
Unfortunately, I couldn’t work on my Java code today, which has left me feeling a bit off balance. Java is a crucial part of my learning goals, and missing a day feels like a setback. However, I plan to compensate tomorrow by allocating extra time to dive deep into my coding tasks.

Here’s hoping for a more balanced day tomorrow with progress on all fronts!
