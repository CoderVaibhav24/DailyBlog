## 1st December

Today was quite productive as I explored several new concepts and solved some challenging problems.

### Three.js Learning
I focused on several core topics in Three.js today, including:
- **Scene**
- **Camera**
- **Object**
- **Light**
- **Renderer**
- **Orbital Control**
- **Animation**

These components are crucial for creating engaging 3D visualizations on the web, and I'm feeling more confident in using them effectively.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
After that, I switched gears to work on string and stack topics. Here are the problems I solved:

1. **Valid Palindrome**  
   - Solution: Used two pointers, traversing from both ends and comparing the characters.
2. **Valid Anagram**  
   - Solution: Utilized two HashMaps and compared them using the `.equals` function.
3. **Valid Parentheses**  
   - Solution: Implemented a stack to push open brackets and validated them against the closing ones.
4. **Remove Consecutive Characters**  
   - Solution: Used `StringBuilder` to append characters by cross-checking consecutive duplicates.

It was great to refresh my understanding of String, `StringBuilder`, and Stack while also solving practical problems.

That's all for today! I'll be back tomorrow with more updates.
