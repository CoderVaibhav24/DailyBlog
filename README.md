# DailyBlog

## 1st December

Today was quite productive as I explored several new concepts and solved some challenging problems.

### Three.js Learning
I focused on several core topics in Three.js today, including:
- **Scene**
- **Camera**
- **Object**
- **Light**
- **Renderer**
- **Orbital Control**
- **Animation**

These components are crucial for creating engaging 3D visualizations on the web, and I'm feeling more confident in using them effectively.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
After that, I switched gears to work on string and stack topics. Here are the problems I solved:

1. **Valid Palindrome**  
   - Solution: Used two pointers, traversing from both ends and comparing the characters.
2. **Valid Anagram**  
   - Solution: Utilized two HashMaps and compared them using the `.equals` function.
3. **Valid Parentheses**  
   - Solution: Implemented a stack to push open brackets and validated them against the closing ones.
4. **Remove Consecutive Characters**  
   - Solution: Used `StringBuilder` to append characters by cross-checking consecutive duplicates.

It was great to refresh my understanding of String, `StringBuilder`, and Stack while also solving practical problems.

That's all for today! I'll be back tomorrow with more updates.

## 2nd December

Today was quite a productive day as I made significant progress on a couple of different fronts.

### Portfolio Website Development

I started building my portfolio website using **React Three Fiber** and **globe.gl** to add a 3D globe to the site. The integration of the 3D globe will create a more interactive and engaging experience for visitors. React Three Fiber has been quite interesting to work with so far, especially in making a 3D visualization functional within a React environment.

### Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

In addition to my work on the portfolio, I also focused on solving a few algorithmic problems related to strings. Here are the questions I solved today:

1. **Longest Common Prefix**  
   - Solution: Implemented a loop to compare the characters of each string in the array, stopping when mismatches were found.

2. **Convert a Sentence into its Equivalent Mobile Numeric Keypad Sequence**  
   - Solution: Used a `HashMap` to map each character to its corresponding numeric value, then used a `StringBuilder` to build the sequence.

3. **Print all the Duplicates in the Input String**  
   - Solution: Created a `HashMap` to map characters and their frequencies, then printed those with a frequency greater than 1.

4. **Longest Substring without Repeating Characters**  
   - Solution: Utilized a sliding window approach with two pointers, combined with a `boolean` array to track visited characters.

5. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**  
   - Solution: Used a two-pointer sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring with repeating characters after a given number of replacements.

### Keynotes
- Using the `substring()` and `indexOf()` methods to generate substrings effectively.
- Leveraging `HashMap` to manage character-to-frequency relationships and streamline tasks like finding duplicates or converting characters.
- Practicing double pointers and sliding window techniques, which are particularly useful for efficiently solving problems involving substrings.

Overall, I had a good mix of both creative and analytical tasks today, which kept me engaged and motivated. Looking forward to more coding adventures tomorrow!
